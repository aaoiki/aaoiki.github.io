        <p>Im my quest of finding the ultimate productivity framework, I came across the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="blank">Pomodoro technique</a>.
The basic idea behind it is to divide the work into equal chunks of time and
take a small break after each set. Usually it goes by working for 25 minutes in
complete concentration, taking a 5 minutes break and repeating the cycle until
the the task is completed.</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>It was the beginning of January this year when I decided to use the Pomodoro
technique to help me study for my finals. However, I could not find a web app
with a simple interface to use and thought it would be a good practice to build
it. I remeber it was right before the start of my odd semester final exams when
I started the project. As you know, finals is the time in which you can achieve
all what you wanted since the beginning of the semester, except studying of
course. Having built the app, it actually came of a great help. In fact I’m
using it right now as I’m writing this post (took me 5 sets to finish it).</p>

<p>I kept in mind to keep the interface as simple as possible. The home page is
where you can start/stop the timer. There’s also a tracker page where you can
keep track of your sets.
I named it <a href="http://panadoura.herokuapp.com/" target="blank">Panadoura</a>.</p>

<h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3>
<p>It started out with simple CoffeeScript file that runs and stops the timer and
served it in a Sinatra app. Then added some more stuff along the way. Besides
being a simple web app, the reason why I started with Sinatra was that I wanted
to get out from under Rails umbrella and try some other alternatives for the
web in Ruby. Of course, this comes with a lot of tradeoffs. Rails embraces the
convention over configuration philosophy which makes it super easy to setup new
applications and get to the work quickly. To try something different, I had to
have some kind of a shift in mind. I also needed to write some bootstrapping
scripts in order to glue the different components of my app together.</p>

<p>The architecture is a bit different from the normal MVC Rails-y way. It
resembles the structure of a normal Ruby gem where the main logic in the app
lives under <code class="highlighter-rouge">lib/</code> directory whereas the application routes and views are in
<code class="highlighter-rouge">app/</code>.</p>

<p>The application layer consists of a single file that defines all the routes to
the web app. It contains the logic that authorizes the users from Twitter and
routes them to the home page. It calls two helper classes; one to load the
assets, and another to configure user sessions.</p>

<p>For the persistence layer, I used <a href="http://rom-rb.org/" target="blank">rom-rb</a>
which philosophy is to decouple different responsibilities and distribute them
over many components/layers. I had to write a wrapper to load the database
settings and connect ROM to PostgreSQL. I also wrote a simple method to run the
migrations.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m using Heroku experimental tier to host the app. The source code
is on
