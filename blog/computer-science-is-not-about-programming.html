        <p>This is not yet another war post about the difference between this and that. In
fact, what’s motivated me to write this post is a TA at my university who was
shaming students who graduate university without learning how to program
properly. This idea was intriguing to me as I thought to myself that computer
science is not about programming!</p>

<p><img src="/public/images/hamada_helal_hamada_helal.jpg" alt="Hamada Helal, the king of obvious" /></p>

<p>Actually, what I believe is that computer science is about computing. According
to Merriam-Webster, the definition of computer science is “a branch of science
that deals with the theory of computation or the design of computers”.  On the
other hand, programming is merely one way to do computation, supposedly, in a
short period of time using a big calculator that is a computer (I know, cell
phones exist!). Having computers do calculations for us is just an extra
privilege.</p>

<p>More so, computations don’t have to be done on a computer. An A4 sheet of paper
and a pencil could be used as a computer, although this is much slower and many
times harder to follow and keep track of compared to a regular computer.  There
are indeed many ways to do computations without a programming language. A
theoretical model of computation is a model which describes how a set of
outputs are computed given a set of inputs. One of the most famous models of
computation is the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Turing_machine" target="blank"><em>Turing
machine</em></a>. A
Turing machine is an abstract computer that has an infinite memory and can
sequentially traverse this memory as needed. It resembles a program which takes
an input and computes an output (in terms of accepting or rejecting the input)
but has access to an infinite memory.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Computer science is about computing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have seen many students who were excellent students but were poor programmers
and that’s totally fine. Those students, if they want to, can pick up academia
and research for example, become computer scientists and excel at that.  In
contrast, I consider myself a fairly good programmer, however; I also consider
myself a not-so-good student. It doesn’t have to be a choice between either of
this or that; of course, this is not a general rule. One can be a good academic
and a good programmer at the same time.</p>

<p>The thing about degrees is that computer science students expect that their
major should include more “programming” courses and they blame their degrees
for the lack of computer programming classes (I used to think that way when I
started my degree). However, what they are missing here is what computer
science is actually concerned with —namely, the theory behind computation.</p>

<p>In conclusion, computer programming is only one form of doing computation.
Understanding the theory behind computation is different from writing programs
to do the computation.</p>
