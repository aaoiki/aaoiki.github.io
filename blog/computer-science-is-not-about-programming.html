        <p>What’s motivated me to write this post is that a TA at my university was once
shaming students who graduate university without learning how to program
properly. This sentence was intriguing to me as I thought to myself that
computer science is not about programming!</p>

<p><img src="/public/images/hamada_helal_hamada_helal.jpg" alt="Hamada Helal, the king of obvious" /></p>

<p>In fact, what I believe is that computer science is about computing. According
to Merriam-Webster, the definition of computer science is “a branch of science
that deals with the theory of computation or the design of computers”.  On the
other hand, programming is merely one way to do computation, supposedly, in a
short period of time using a big calculator that is a computer (I know, cell
phones exist!). Having computers do calculations for us is just an extra
privilege.</p>

<p>More so, computations don’t have to be done on a computer. An A4 sheet of paper
and a pencil could be used as a computer, although this is a much slower and
many times harder to follow and keep track of compared to a regular computer.
There are indeed many ways to do computation without a programming language.
There are what’s known as theoretical models of computation. One
<strong>theoretical</strong> model of computation is a <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Turing_machine" target="blank"><em>Turing
machine</em></a>.  A
Turing machine is an abstract computer that has an infinite memory and can
sequentially traverse this memory as needed but we won’t discuss it more in
this post.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Computer science is about computing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have seen many students who were excellent students but were poor programmers
and that’s totally fine. Those students, if they want to, can pick up academia
and research for example, become computer scientists and excel at that.  In
contrast, I consider myself a fairly good programmer, however; I also consider
myself a not-so-good student. It doesn’t have to be a choice between either
this or that; of course, this is not a rule. One can be a good academic and a
good programmer at the same time.</p>

<p>The thing about degrees is that computer science students expect that their
major should include more “programming” courses and they blame their degrees
for the lack of computer programming classes (I used to think that way when I
started my degree). However, what they are missing here is what computer
science is actually concerned with —namely, the theory behind computation.</p>

<p>In conclusion, computer programming is only one form of doing computation.
Understanding the theory behind computation is different from writing programs
to do the calculations.</p>
