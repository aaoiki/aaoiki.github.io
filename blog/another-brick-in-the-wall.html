        <p>This post is exactly three years old. I have it in my drafts since the
beginning of 2016. The first draft has nothing to do with its current form. My
opinions have greatly changed since then (it’s a good way to self-reflection, I
must say). The original title was “Another Brick in the wall?”. I added the
second or-part to it to reflect what it is about right now.</p>

<p>Originally, this post was going to be a long rant about CS education, however;
as I said, my opinions have changed since that time. This post is now about why
CS education is important for future, wanna-be software developers.</p>

<p>By the end of 2017, I left my work at Robusta Studio to go back to school and
finish my CS degree after stalling for two years. I’m sure the folks at
<a href="https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions" target="blank">/r/cscareerquestions</a>
will probably have a lot of advice regarding this matter, on why it’s useless
to leave a full-time paying job and go back to school. Well, I beg to differ.
Having a CS degree specially for young unexperienced developers is as important
as acquiring programming skills. Here’s why you may need to consider going for
a CS degree.</p>

<h3 id="theoretical-fundamentals">Theoretical Fundamentals</h3>

<p>This is <a href="/blog/computer-science-is-not-about-programming">the base</a> of computer
science education; the theory behind computation. You cannot take on computer
science without learning tons of theoretical materials. This theoretical
knowledge prepares you to be a better programmer by understanding why and how a
certain technology works behind the scene. It’s true that you probably won’t
need most of the theoretical stuff in your day-to-day job but…</p>

<h3 id="time-management">Time Management</h3>

<p>With literally tens of projects each year, you need to learn to manage your
time properly between putting the effort to study and doing the school
projects. This is something I learned the hard way. Time management is an
invaluable skill in software development career. You need to learn how to
estimate your projects and give reasonable timeline for each task.</p>

<h3 id="networking">Networking</h3>

<p>If you doubt my other reasons for going into computer science, you cannot deny
this one. Having a network of like-minded peers and friends is the first thing
that comes to my mind when I think about pros of computer science education.
This network will probably help you later in your career when you find out that
most company hiring is unannounced to the public but rather, companies depend
on their own network of developers to hire from.</p>

<h3 id="credibility">Credibility</h3>

<p>Again, another reason for your software development career. Although there may
be a general direction of not requiring a degree, many companies still do
require a CS degree from their candidates. And although there are companies
that may not require a CS degree to hire you, having a CS degree makes you look
more credible to your future employer specially if it’s your first job and
you’re without experience.</p>

<h3 id="social-considerations">Social Considerations</h3>

<p>Society is not ready to accept that education does not have to come from
universities.</p>

<h3 id="a-brief-story">A brief story</h3>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Before CS college, I had a great passion for programming.</p>

<p>I was first introduced to programming at the age of 11 by our neighbor who was
a software developer. He gave me a version of Visual Basic 5 on a weird
sticky thing called a <em>flash drive</em> (yup, they were new). I
installed VB and started looking up the internet for VB scripts and how to run
them. I dropped my jaw when I could eject the CD-ROM drawer using VB code!
It was some kind of a fun game and it was all about passion.</p>

<p>After high school, it was very obvious to me that I should join a
programming-related field, and I did, I joined a CS faculty in one of the
reputable universities in the country.</p>

<p>I do respect the staff. They are great people.
I don’t want to put this as a way to hate or to deny</p>

<h3 id="you-will-get-a-zero">You will get a ZERO!</h3>
<p>I’ve heard this word so many times during the past years.
Here’s a section from a submission guideline I had for one project in one course</p>

<p><img src="/public/images/another_brick_submission_guideline.png" alt="Submission Guideline" /></p>

<p>It’s like grades is a way to manipulate students or threaten them.
I even made a <a href="https://gist.github.com/aaoiki/89574ce24f22d59799ae" target="blank">simple script</a>
to count how many <code class="highlighter-rouge">ZERO</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">Do NOT</code> words there are in those guidlelines.</p>

<h3 id="its-a-policy">It’s a Policy</h3>
<p>There’s always this stupid policy what when they want you stop doing something,
they will throw it at your face right away.</p>

<h3 id="people-actually-learn-differently">People actually learn differently</h3>
<p>Yup that’s true. I learn differently so fuck off. I came by this
