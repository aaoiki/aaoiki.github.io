        <p><a href="http://threevirtues.com/" target="blank">One of the three great virtues of a programmer is laziness</a>
and it’s actually culturally acceptable that programmers are lazy by nature
(not judging). Programmers write software to replace mundane and repetitive
tasks and let their computers work for them instead, and that’s why, programmers have ever
since created so many frameworks [aframeworkeveryday.js], libraries,
and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="blank">practices</a>
only to avoid repeating work (or doing it altogether).</p>

<p>And <a href="https://vimeo.com/158129287" target="blank">in this realm of eternal laziness</a>,
programmers make backups of their system settings and coding environment, and
write scripts to bootstrap and link their configuration files so they can
easily setup and share them on other machines. These packages are known among
programmers as dotfiles!</p>

<h3 id="what-are-they">What are they?</h3>
<p>First of all, what is a dotfile you may ask? A dotfile, in Unix-like systems,
is a file that starts with a dot/period and hence the name. They resemble
hidden files in Windows systems. If you are coming from a Unix-like system, you
will find some dotfiles in your home directory by performing an <code class="highlighter-rouge">$ ls -a ~</code> in
a terminal. These are mostly configuration files. You can view them in Gnome
file manager (might have a different keymap for other file managers) by
pressing <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+H</code>.</p>

<h3 id="up-to-the-point">Up to the Point</h3>
<p>I’ve had <a href="https://github.com/aonemd/aaku" target="blank">my dotfiles</a> for
quite some time. Every once in a while, I refactor them, change them
consistently to suit my uses, or sometimes, I completely change the way they
are bootstrapped.</p>

<p>More recently, I noticed that my shell was pretty slow on startup. I was using
<a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh" target="blank">Oh-My-Zsh</a> back
then and it was great but, as I mentioned, slow. I wanted to give
<a href="https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto" target="blank">Prezto</a> a try around
that time. And I did! Prezto was more convenient for me, a little smaller than
Oh-My-Zsh, and a little faster but still, it shipped with a lot of plugins and
configurations that I never used (or never knew about as far as I’m concerned).
Eventually, I ended up writing my ZSH configuration from scratch.</p>

<p>There’s a kind of a division here between whether you should
<a href="https://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/" target="blank">fork someone else’s dotfiles and build up from there</a>
or start from scratch. In the end, it’s all about personal taste and needs.</p>

<h3 id="good-tools-do-not-make-a-good-carpenter">Good Tools Do Not Make a Good Carpenter</h3>
<p>I have spent (and still spend) a lot of time changing and tweaking my
environment to my taste and it may look like an obsessions (it probably is),
let’s not forget one important thing here: using these tools to practice and
write software is actually more important than the tools themselves.  Although
I take a great pride in my configurations and tools, I believe it is a slippery
slope to let a subtask take over your time and replace the actual work.</p>

<p>There’s a story told about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Shafi%E2%80%98i" target="blank">Al-Shafi‘i</a>,
a Muslim scholar, jurist, and poet who lived in the 8th century, that he had to
take long walks in order to get to his lectures and classes. He said: “How could
I pay attention to my classes if I didn’t have a donkey?!” and bought himself a
donkey. The story goes that after sometime, Al-Shafi‘i became very occupied
taking care of his donkey cleaning and feeding it that he said: “How could I
pay attention to my classes if I had a donkey?!”.</p>
