    <p><a href="http://threevirtues.com/" target="blank">One of the three great virtues of a programmer is laziness</a>.
Programming calls for replacing repetitive work with automated tasks.
We, programmers, create frameworks, CLI tools,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="blank">software engineering principles</a>,
and helper methods only to avoid repeating our work.</p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/158129287" target="blank">In this realm of eternal laziness</a>,
programmers package their environment settings and configuration files and
bootstrap them into a single package that needs only one or few commands to
install. That is called the dotfiles!</p>

<h3 id="what-are-they">What are they?</h3>
<p>First of all what is a dotfile? A dotfile, in Unix-like systems, is a file that
starts with a dot/period and hence the name. They resemble hidden files in
Windows environment. If you are coming from a Unix-like system, you will find
some dotfiles in your home directory by doing an <code class="highlighter-rouge">$ ls -a ~</code>. These are mostly
configuration files. You can view them in Ubuntu file manager (might change for
different file managers) by pressing <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ctrl+H</code>.</p>

<h3 id="up-to-the-point">Up to the Point</h3>
<p>I’ve had <a href="https://github.com/aaoiki/aaku" target="blank">my dotfiles</a> for
quite some time. Every once in a while, I used to refactor them, change how
they look, or completely change the way they were linked.  More recently, I
noticed that my shell was pretty slow on startup. I used
<a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh" target="blank">Oh-My-Zsh!</a> back
then which was awesome but, as mentioned, a bit slow. I then wanted to give
<a href="https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto" target="blank">Prezto</a> a try.
Prezto was more convenient for me and faster but still it contained a lot of
stuff that I never used. Eventually, I ended up writing my Zsh configuration
from scratch.</p>

<p>There’s a kind of philosophy here between whether you should
<a href="https://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/" target="blank">fork someone else’s dotfiles and build up from there</a>
or start from scratch. However, it’s all about personal taste and needs.</p>

<h3 id="good-tools-do-not-make-a-good-carpenter">Good Tools Do Not Make a Good Carpenter</h3>
<p>After I had made a lot of changes and rewritten almost everything, it kind of
felt like I became obsessed with my dotfiles and how they looked instead of
actually getting the real stuff done (A.K.A., using them for programming). This
is a slippery slope. However important it is to prepare and sharpen the tools
needed for a job, it should not replace the actual work.</p>

<p>There’s a story told about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Shafi%E2%80%98i" target="blank">Al-Shafi‘i</a>,
a Muslim scholar, jurist, and poet who lived in the 8th century, that he had to
take long walks in order to get to his lectures and classes. He said “How can
I focus on my studies if I don’t have a donkey to ride?!” and bought himself a
donkey. The story goes that after sometime, Al-Shafi‘i became very occupied
taking care of his donkey cleaning and feeding it so he said: “How can I
focus on my studies if I have a donkey?!”.</p>
