      <description>In my quest of finding the ultimate productivity framework, I came across the Pomodoro technique. The basic idea behind it is to divide the work into equal chunks of time and take a small break after each set. Usually it goes by working for 25 minutes in complete concentration, taking a 5 minutes break and repeating the cycle until the task is completed.
Motivation It was the beginning of January this year when I decided to use the Pomodoro technique to help me study for my finals.</description>
