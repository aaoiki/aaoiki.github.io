      <description>Why I write There maybe a lot of reasons for this. For starters, I think writing is a fun activity. I write mainly to improve my communication skills, written communication skills apparently. Another reason I write for is to give back to the communities I&amp;rsquo;m involved in and maybe benefit someone someday with something I wrote. Teaching is such a precious experience. Teaching and teaching through writing here does not only benefit the reader but also the writer cause when I write, I get to deepen and widen my knowledge base.</description>
