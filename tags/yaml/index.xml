      <description>This is the story of a bug I encountered about 3 years ago. Basically, I had a model Book that contained a serialized object attribute called info and BooksController initially contained this search query:
Book.where(&amp;#39;info LIKE ?&amp;#39;, &amp;#34;%ref: &amp;#39;#{params[:ref]}&amp;#39;&amp;#34;) The bug that surfaced at the time was that some books were not fetched when the search query contained alpha-numeric reference numbers (those that contains both digits and letters) as some reference numbers were pure digits and some were a mix of digits and alphabetical characters.</description>
