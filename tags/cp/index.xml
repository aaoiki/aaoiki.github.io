      <description>I first started writing Go during my time at UserTalk and have been using it occasionaly since then because of its minimal syntax and standard library that makes it a great language for writing almost any kind of software.
Whenever I&amp;rsquo;m solving a competitive programming problem, I usually use C or C++ (whichever works best) to write the solution mainly because they are both supported by almost all online judges and programming contests.</description>
