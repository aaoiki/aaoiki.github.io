      <description>This is the story of a bug I encountered about 3 years ago. Basically, I had a model Book that contained a serialized object attribute called info and BooksController initially contained this search query:
Book.where(&amp;#39;info LIKE ?&amp;#39;, &amp;#34;%ref: &amp;#39;#{params[:ref]}&amp;#39;&amp;#34;) The bug that surfaced at the time was that some books were not fetched when the search query contained alpha-numeric reference numbers (those that contains both digits and letters) as some reference numbers were pure digits and some were a mix of digits and alphabetical characters.</description>

      <description>Ruby on Rails is a great web framework. It has changed the way web development is done and influenced other frameworks in other programming languages. Even admittedly, much of the major success of Ruby is due to the wide spread of Rails.
Being the opinionated framework it is, Rails is built on top of a set of conventions and philosophies. It&amp;rsquo;s said to be Omakase (お任せ) or chef&amp;rsquo;s menu of choice (also, watch Rails is Omakase: A Dramatic Reading).</description>
