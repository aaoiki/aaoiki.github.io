      <description>According to Wikipedia, Pair Programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation.
There&amp;rsquo;s also a term I call Bear programming that is not the opposite of pair programming. Bear programming is when a team of programmers that work together on a single project starts mauling the code and ripping its different parts apart like a group of bears.
Let me clear this. The mauling here refers to writing code that is distinguishable to the code written by other team members.</description>
