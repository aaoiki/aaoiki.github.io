      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been revisiting my old repositories on GitHub recently to make sure they are still relevant and to clean up the code. One of the projects I looked into was margopher which I started back in August 2015. I only removed some unused code, and updated the README page after which I decided to follow the usage instructions just to make sure everything was okay. This was when I found out that when I created and used a margopher object one time, I could not use it any more.</description>
