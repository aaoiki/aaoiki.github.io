      <description>This is the story of a bug I encountered about 3 years ago. Basically, I had a model Book that contained a serialized object attribute called info and BooksController initially contained this search query:
Book.where(&amp;#39;info LIKE ?&amp;#39;, &amp;#34;%ref: &amp;#39;#{params[:ref]}&amp;#39;&amp;#34;) The bug that surfaced at the time was that some books were not fetched when the search query contained alpha-numeric reference numbers (those that contains both digits and letters) as some reference numbers were pure digits and some were a mix of digits and alphabetical characters.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been revisiting my old repositories on GitHub recently to make sure they are still relevant and to clean up the code. One of the projects I looked into was margopher which I started back in August 2015. I only removed some unused code, and updated the README page after which I decided to follow the usage instructions just to make sure everything was okay. This was when I found out that when I created and used a margopher object one time, I could not use it any more.</description>
