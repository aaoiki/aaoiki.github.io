      <description>Why I write There maybe a lot of reasons for this. For starters, I think writing is a fun activity. I write mainly to improve my communication skills, written communication skills apparently. Another reason I write for is to give back to the communities I&amp;rsquo;m involved in and maybe benefit someone someday with something I wrote. Teaching is such a precious experience. Teaching and teaching through writing here does not only benefit the reader but also the writer cause when I write, I get to deepen and widen my knowledge base.</description>

      <description>This website is generated by Jekyll, the static site generator. For compiling assets (mainly Javascript and stylsheet files), I’ve been using Sprockets through Jekyll Assets gem. Although recently, and after I had updated the gems in Jekyll’s Gemfile, a new update for Jekyll asset was pushed. It appears they decided to change their entire interface. This rendered my whole project unusable and I needed to change every call to Jekyll Assets new interface in order to fix it.</description>
