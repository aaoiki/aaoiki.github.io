      <description>This post has been in my drafts since the beginning of 2016. I wanted to postpone releasing it until I have the full view. And now that I have just received the results of my last course at university, I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to finally publish this post. Since this comes from my own experience, I cannot remain objective in this post. Also, the first two drafts of this post has nothing to do with its current form.</description>

      <description>This is not yet another war post about the difference between this and that. In fact, what&amp;rsquo;s motivated me to write this post is a TA at my university who was shaming students who graduate university without learning how to program properly. This idea was intriguing to me as I thought to myself that computer science is not about programming!
Actually, what I believe is that computer science is about computing.</description>
