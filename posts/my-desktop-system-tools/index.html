        <div lang='en'>
          <p>In this post, I will go over how I setup my desktop system for programming and
general media usage. Please note that this setup is heavily keyboard driven
since I rarely use the touchpad or the mouse except maybe for web browsing or
graphics software.</p>
<h3 id="machine">Machine</h3>
<p>My main machine is a 2017 Thinkpad X1 Carbon. I like it for it&rsquo;s small size,
light weight, and Linux support. It is mainly a programming machine for me. It
doesn&rsquo;t contain a dedicated graphics card so it has low power consumption and
zero issues with Linux in that regard (no fan noises). Although, I may have
some issues with the quality control of the machine.</p>
<h3 id="operating-system">Operating System</h3>
<p>My operating system for years has been exclusively GNU/Linux (to the point that
now I get confused if I tried to use a Windows 10 machine). I have used and
tried many many distributions of Linux be it Debian based, SUSE based, Red Hat
based, and finally Arch Linux based systems. I have had my fair share of distro
hopping along the years. However, Arch Linux has been on my machine for the
longest time without a reinstall compared to other systems. Although known as a
rolling release system, Arch Linux has been very stable on my machine with
almost zero issues even though I don&rsquo;t do system updates on a regular basis (I
update the system whenever I remember or when I can afford to restart my
machine). The benefit of using Arch Linux is that it is bare bones so I can
customize it however I want. Also, the benefit of always having the most
updated software is a great feature.</p>
<p>I wrote a comprehensive guide for installing Arch Linux on
<a href="https://gist.github.com/aonemd/96fd9bf2e42df4869a099f433c074907">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h3 id="desktop-environment">Desktop Environment</h3>
<p>The Linux world and the free software world in general have a great variety in
the available tools and software. This includes the desktop environments.  I
have tried many desktop environments as well and finally got to the point that
no desktop environment is the best desktop environment. Well, that&rsquo;s not
totally correct. A desktop environment is a nothing but a bunch of tools
bundled and installed together. These tools include things like the graphical
use interface with a tool bar and a system tray, an app finder, a window
manager, a file manager, notification daemon, a login session manager, and so
many other tools for various tasks. The issue here is that each desktop
environment installs so many packages that are probably not at all needed by
everyone. For me, I like to use certain tools that may render desktop
environment default installed tools redundant.</p>
<p>This is the reason I turned into using minimal tools to manage my desktop and
thus, creating my own desktop environment (sort of).</p>
<p>For starters, my graphical user interface is rendered and managed by the X11
windowing system. Although,
<a href='https://wayland.freedesktop.org/' target='_blank'><em>Wayland</em></a>
popularity is rising, most of the current Linux GUI software is compatible with
the X protocol.</p>
<p>To manage my windows, I use a tiling window manager; one that tiles the windows
next to each other by default instead of stacking them on top of each other.
There are many window managers that operate differently. The most popular
window managers are
<a href='https://i3wm.org/' target='_blank'><em>i3wm</em></a>,
<a href='https://awesomewm.org/index.html' target='_blank'><em>Awesome</em></a>, and
<a href='https://xmonad.org/' target='_blank'><em>XMonad</em></a>. I suggest starting
out with <em>i3wm</em> and experimenting from there.  My window manager of choice is
<a href='https://dwm.suckless.org/' target='_blank'><em>dwm</em></a>.
I chose <em>dwm</em> mainly because it&rsquo;s so minimal and its config file is written in
C instead of a special DSL. <em>dwm</em> is a part of a group of tools known as the
<a href='https://suckless.org/' target='_blank'><em>suckless</em></a> tools.</p>
<p>Since <em>dwm</em> is minimal, it doesn&rsquo;t come with a tool bar by default. The user
needs to write their own bar. I see most users write an infinite loop in bash
and output the data they need into the bar. However, I don&rsquo;t think this is an
efficient approach. <a href="http://github.com/aonemd/onpar">I wrote my own bar in Go</a>
that schedules each section of the bar to run concurrently. It&rsquo;s been running
on my system for years and I barely feel it running.</p>

<h3 id="terminal-emulator">Terminal Emulator</h3>
<p>Again and again, the Linux world enjoys a great variety of available software.
For terminal emulators, my choice has been the
<a href='https://st.suckless.org/' target='_blank'><em>st</em></a>
terminal. The <em>st</em> terminal emulator is also a
part of the suckless tools and is very minimal and light.  It&rsquo;s configured in C
as well. A more extremely fast, full-featured terminal emulator I&rsquo;d recommend
is <a href='https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/' target='_blank'><em>kitty</em></a>.</p>
<h3 id="text-editor">Text Editor</h3>
<p>For text editing, I use Vim exclusively. Although, I have been fascinated by
the capabilities of Visual Studio Code recently, I always go for Vim for its
minimal text editing workflow and the ability to run it inside a terminal
emulator session so it&rsquo;s usable everywhere, be it the desktop or the server.  I
have written <a href="/categories#vim">a small series of posts</a> about configuring Vim.</p>
<h3 id="file-manager">File manager</h3>
<p>Since I started with a keyboard driven setup, my file manager should be
keyboard driven as well.  There are many good CLI file managers. I have been
using
<a href='https://github.com/ranger/ranger' target='_blank'><em>ranger</em></a> for a long time.
However, I recently discovered <a href='https://github.com/jarun/nnn' target='_blank'><em>nnn</em></a>
which is faster (written in C), minimal, and more modular. I have to say that I
cheat sometimes and use <em>Thunar</em> (mainly to manage external devices such as USB
sticks and mobile devices).</p>
<h3 id="media-software">Media Software</h3>
<p>My media software usage is very light. I only have
<a href='https://www.videolan.org/vlc/' target='_blank'><em>VLC</em></a> for video and
<a href='https://cmus.github.io/' target='_blank'><em>cmus</em></a> for music. Some people use
<a href='https://mpv.io/' target='_blank'><em>MPV</em></a> which, to me, looks like a
great option but I have yet to invest some time using it to make the final
decision (I will probably update this post with my findings).</p>
<p>UPDATE: I used <em>mpv</em> for a couple of days, tried to configure it but gave up,
mainly, because I have enough config files already and I don&rsquo;t need to worry
about different decoders and shaders in order to play media (which is so
minimal compared to my day-to-day computer needs).</p>
<h3 id="final-note">Final Note</h3>
<p>I advise you to experiment and evaluate different tools and try to customize
your system to your liking. I understand that the great variety of available
tools can lead to some kind of choice overload bias (more options, more
difficult time to choose), however; just starting somewhere (even starting out
with popular tools) can lead to better evaluation and better decision making.</p>
<p>Finally, if you want some inspiration, you can take a look at <a href="https://github.com/aonemd/aaku">my configuration
files on GitHub</a>.</p>
