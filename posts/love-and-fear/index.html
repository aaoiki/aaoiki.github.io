          <blockquote>
<p>I remember once, in crossing the Atlantic, to have gone upon the deck of the
ship at midnight, when a dense black cloud enveloped the sky, and the great
deep was roaring madly under the lashes of demoniac winds. My feeling was not
of danger or fear (which is a base surrender of the immortal soul), but of
utter desolation and loneliness; a little speck of life shut in by a tremendous
darkness.  When I was young, I believed the same nonsense that a lot of people
believe about happiness - that it comes from the flashy veneer of the American
dream: money, status, and power. But then I grew up (unlike too many other
people, who only grow older) and I began to see that these things often
destroyed happiness. I learned that happiness only comes from inner qualities,
such as courage, altruism, and optimism. Happiness comes from the self. But
where is the self? Who is the self? Who are you? If you don&rsquo;t know, you&rsquo;ll
never be happy, because you&rsquo;ll never be able to connect with the inner core
qualities that make happiness possible. You&rsquo;ll just travel through life in
circles, always going, always intent - never arriving, never content. You
should, in fact, be able to describe exactly who you are, right now, in the
proverbial 25 words or less.  And yet, there is a solitude, which each and
every one of us has always carried with him, more inaccessible than the
ice-cold mountains, more profound than the midnight sea; the solitude of self.
Our inner being, which we call ourself, no eye nor touch of man or angel has
ever pierced. Such is individual life. Who, I ask you, can take, dare take, on
himself the rights, the duties, the responsibilities of another human soul?&hellip;
&hellip;if we&rsquo;re ever going to be truly happy&hellip;we need to be willing to charge
headlong into the inferno of our most horrific fears - eyes open, intellect and
spirit at the ready - even as our survival instincts are screaming, &lsquo;Run! Run!
Get out!&rsquo; That takes courage, and that&rsquo;s why courage is one of the
prerequisites for happiness. Courage, they say, is not the lack of fear, but
the ability to take action in spite of it. But where does that ability come
from? What power grants the strength to overcome the sick, shaky feeling of
fear? Only one power is that strong: love. In the ultimate analysis, human
beings have only two essential primal feelings: fear and love. Fear impels us
to survive, and love enables us to thrive. This complementary pair of feelings
has been the driving force of human history. Fear is the product of the
reptilian brain, hardwired into every fiber of our being, and love is the
product of the neocortical higher brain, where spirit and intellect reside.
Thus, the dance of the spirit and reptile - the shifting balance between the
neocortex and the reptilian brain - is the dance of love and fear. For you to
be happy, love must lead this dance.  Nature loves courage. You make the
commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible
obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under,
it will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and
philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this
is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is
how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering it&rsquo;s a
feather bed.</p>

<p>This quote is not mine. I have read it a while ago in a YouTube comment and I
knew I had to keep it in my notes for difficult times. Now I want to share with
you. I couldn&rsquo;t trace the origin of the quote so all credits are due to the
original writer/author.</p>
<p>In search for a purpose, we often direct our efforts into materialistic goals.
However, materialistic objects do and will get old and dull. What doesn&rsquo;t get
old though, is responsibility. This responsibility, however; is never easy to
take on. Thus, in order to face the truth of oneself and to take on
responsibility, one needs courage; the courage to say what they mean, to do
what they believe in, to ask for and get what they want, and to live up to
their potential and up to their values.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have much to say after this so I will just end the post with this
quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Truth and responsibility is the secret to a meaningful life, and without the
meaningful life, then all you have is suffering and nihilism and despair and
self-contempt.
