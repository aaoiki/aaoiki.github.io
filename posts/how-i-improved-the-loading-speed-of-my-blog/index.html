        <div lang='en'>
          <p>In this post I&rsquo;m going to demonstrate the steps I took in order to improve the
loading speed of my blog. First of all, this blog is generated by
<a target="_blank" href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, the static site generator.  I
only build my static files and deploy them to GitHub pages. I use Webpack to
compile my assets and then I use Jekyll to build the whole blog.</p>
<p>Around a year ago, I started on a mission to optimize the loading speed of my
blog after feeling that it was slow and had some rendering issues. The next two
screenshots demonstrate the difference in terms of loading time before and
after the optimization:</p>
<p><a href="/images/blog_performance_old.png"><img src="/images/blog_performance_old.png" alt="Old Blog Loading"></a>
&laquo; old blog loading in 3.56s in Chrome developer tools &raquo;</p>
<p><a href="/images/blog_performance_new.png"><img src="/images/blog_performance_new.png" alt="New Blog Loading"></a>
&laquo; new blog loading in 600ms in chrome developer tools &raquo;</p>
<p>In the next few points, I will list the steps I took to make my blog load
faster than it used to:</p>
<h3 id="1-zurb-foundation">1. Zurb Foundation</h3>
<p>The first thing I started with was completely removing Zurb Foundation, the
CSS framework. I was using Foundation mainly for its grid system but I never
really used most of its other components. In spite of that, I was,
unknowingly, importing all its components into my main SCSS file (which, of
course, was atrocious). I totally removed Foundation and replaced it with
vanilla CSS (compiled PostCSS, actually). My main <code>index.css</code> file was 242KB
in size. Now, it&rsquo;s a 6.3KB file.</p>
<h3 id="2-font-awesome--font-icons">2. Font Awesome &amp; Font Icons</h3>
<p>This was based on an advice from the great frontend guru <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ahmadalfy">Ahmad Alfy</a>:
replacing Font Awesome with SVGs. There are already many
<a target="_blank" href="https://css-tricks.com/icon-fonts-vs-svg/">articles</a> that
discuss the case for using SVGs instead of font icons. For me, having a
smaller file size to download by specifically adding only the icons I need to
the sprite file, and not seeing empty squares when the file is yet to be
downloaded are two great advantages of using SVGs.</p>
<h3 id="3-google-analytics">3. Google Analytics</h3>
<p>Although it might be useful to some, I didn&rsquo;t really use analytics that much.
For me, the added download time did not justify using Google Analytics
specially that the uncached <code>analytics.js</code> file alone loads from Google
servers in about 200ms.</p>
<h3 id="4-disqus-comments">4. Disqus Comments</h3>
<p>I believe enabling comments in my blog is essential for opening a two-way
channel of feedback. However, <a target="_blank" href="http://donw.io/post/github-comments/#whats-wrong-with-disqus">the biggest issue with disqus</a>
is that it loads too many files and makes API calls to different servers for
tracking and analytics. I have recently worked on an implementation of blog
comments backed by GitHub issues but I haven&rsquo;t deployed it yet.</p>
<h3 id="5-javascript">5. Javascript</h3>
<p>When I started working on this optimization, I wanted a Javascript-free
experience in my blog. That is, I wanted to have every functionality working
normally with or without Javascript. Removing Foundation was a big step in
this direction because, with removing it, its Javascript depdencies were
removed as well. I currently, use Javascript for exactly two functions; one
for loading fonts using <em>Web Font Loader</em>, and the other is for toggling
between the light and the dark theme (Yes, there&rsquo;s a <a href="/blog/introducing-jack-and-dark-theme">dark theme</a> in this blog).
Previously, two JS files were downloaded with a total size of 222KB and
loaded in about 77ms.  Now, it&rsquo;s just a single 20KB file that loads in ~20ms.
Having Javascript files load asynchronously using <code>async</code> to load the main
index.js file also helped a lot in the total loading time of the blog.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Having fewer files for the browser to download, and fewer resources that
access the network help greatly in speeding the page load specially for
static websites such as blogs.</p>
