          <p>This post has been in my drafts since the beginning of 2016. I wanted to
postpone releasing it until I have the full view. And now that I have just
received the results of my last course at university, I think it&rsquo;s time to
finally publish this post. Since this comes from my own experience, I cannot
remain objective in this post. Also, the first two drafts of this post has
nothing to do with its current form.</p>
<p>Okay, here&rsquo;s the short story: I got into university for a computer engineering
degree in 2012, hated every living second of it, decided to focus on
self-learning instead, got myself a few positions as a software engineer,
neglected my studies, decided to finish university anyway, and finally I
graduated!</p>
<p><img src="/images/another_brick_in_the_wall-plan.png" alt="My 5-year plan"></p>
<p>You and I might as well ask why I would go back and finish university after I
got an actual paying job. I went as far as leaving my job at the time in order
to focus on my studies. Well, I believe I had two reasons. First of all, I
wanted to finish what I started.  The second reason is, specially coming from a
third-world nation, I wanted to have that official piece of paper that denotes
I know stuff although, realistically, I might know nothing, but hey, it&rsquo;s the
state of the world we live in!</p>
<p>Now enough about me, let&rsquo;s talk about computer science education. It&rsquo;s widely
debated over the internet whether to go to university for computer science or
to go to a 6-month boot camp that teaches web development basics. Well, in my
opinion, neither of them alone teaches you enough to get a software
engineering job nowadays.</p>
<p>One might say that a computer science degree will teach you the theoretical
fundamentals and the required time management skills, or will give you the
credibility and the opportunity for networking with peers. This all may be
true, but there are caveats.</p>
<p>My biggest issue with formal computer science education is having to follow a
predefined set of courses blindly. The issue here is that the student does not
get to see the full picture of the scientific material and only gets to see a
very narrow scope through the teacher&rsquo;s vision because, of course, it&rsquo;s all
part of a course that should be concluded in 3 months maximum. Now, take that
one course and multiply it by 5 or 6 courses a semester in different topics and
you get yourself scrapes of knowledge from here and there without understanding
why you&rsquo;re learning any of that.</p>
<p>The formal computer science education system does not take into consideration
that people may have different interests. Specially, in the field of computer
science, there are many fields that have their practical applications and their
demanding job markets. Another important aspect that is often neglected in
formal education in general, is that people learn differently. The formal
education system aims at producing graduates with similar educational
backgrounds but with the same mentality which, in my humble opinion, is not
right.</p>
<p>The last issue I&rsquo;m going to discuss in this post is the scientific material.
Well, to put it simply, the scientific material often felt dry or flat and out
of touch with reality. Being fed up during my recent courses, I started asking
questions. A funny incident took place in one of my compiler lectures. I asked
my professor (whom I respect greatly. Seriously, The professor is one of the
greatest teachers I&rsquo;ve ever had) about a method/algorithm that we were being
taught in the course. I asked about if I looked into the code of a real
compiler, could I find the implementation of such algorithm. The professor
clearly said: &ldquo;No&rdquo;. I then asked why. The professor said: &ldquo;because I invented
it!&rdquo; I can say with almost certainty that most of the courses I took followed
that same pattern.</p>
<p>In my opinion, those &ldquo;caveats&rdquo;, are reflected on the job market of software
engineering which is notorious for the need of constant self-learnings.</p>
<p>I would like to conclude this post with saying that I do not encourage nor
discourage a certain path towards software engineering. I believe every
individual has their different case. For me, the important part in any path you
choose is having the patience and persistence to continue learning and going
forward.</p>
