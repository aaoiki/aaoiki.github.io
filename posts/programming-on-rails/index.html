          <p>Ruby on Rails is a great web framework. It has changed the way web development
is done and influenced other frameworks in other programming languages. Even
admittedly, much of the major success of Ruby is due to the wide spread of
Rails.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Ruby_On_Rails_Logo.png" alt="Rails Logo"></p>
<p>Being the opinionated framework it is, Rails is built on top of a set of
conventions and philosophies. It&rsquo;s said to be
<a target="_blank" href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2012/rails-is-omakase.html">Omakase (お任せ)</a>
or chef&rsquo;s menu of choice (also, watch
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E99FnoYqoII">Rails is Omakase: A Dramatic Reading</a>).
Unlike Node&rsquo;s ExpressJS for example, Rails comes preconfigured with all the
stack you need to build your app. Its convenience over configuration led it to
be one of the easiest and fastest ways to start building apps for the web
today.</p>
<p>Of course, this convenience comes at a cost. Apart from the added difficulty to
maintain when the app grows in complexity (which I won&rsquo;t talk about in this
post), the Rails way sets a fixated mindset about programming, namely, web
programming. Your entire world view to programming is through Rails and the
Rails way. For instance, the places where you can create your classes, the way
you connect the backend with the view and the frontend, and the way you write
helper functions or helper modules are all set by the framework, Rails. I&rsquo;m not
discussing here the architectural decisions made by Rails however, I&rsquo;m
pointing to the effect of those decisions on the programmer&rsquo;s mindset.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing Rails for around 4 years now. During this period, whenever I&rsquo;m
working on a task (be it Rails or non-Rails related), I often caught myself
looking to identify a pattern; looking for the framework in it. It&rsquo;s like my
mind wants to see all programming as it sees tedious CRUD applications (which
are totally fine as long as they are solving a problem). The issue here is
restricting my thought process to only one way of thinking however,
programming, or rather the creative thinking it requires, needs more
imagination and less restriction.</p>
<p>Something I also noticed while working with interns is that more fresh minds
tend to be more flexible than experienced developers. Their minds are not yet
bloated with way of the framework and they tend be less following to the rules.</p>
<p>So you might ask what to do in order to free your mind from the Rails way. What
I suggest is to rebel against Rails. Yes, try different Ruby web frameworks,
different languages, new stacks, or even developing for platforms other than
the web altogether. Also, try breaking, bending, and tweaking large, complex
Rails apps to see how far you can get with Rails. Try a new architecture for
your Rails app by dividing your business logic and classes into multiple
layers. The world outside the Rails menu is so vast and diverse but you need to
see that for yourself.</p>
