          <h3 id="why-i-write">Why I write</h3>
<p>There maybe a lot of reasons for this. For starters, I think writing is a fun
activity. I write mainly to improve my communication skills, written
communication skills apparently. Another reason I write for is to give back to
the communities I&rsquo;m involved in and maybe benefit someone someday with
something I wrote. Teaching is such a precious experience. Teaching and
teaching through writing here does not only benefit the reader but also the
writer cause when I write, I get to deepen and widen my knowledge base.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Teach and you shall learn.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="writing-is-hard">Writing is hard</h3>
<p>Seriously, this is the first thing that came to my mind when I thought of
writing this article. Although it might be fun to write, it&rsquo;s very difficult to
put a good article together. The biggest issue for me is when I have a fairly
good idea and I can barely write about it at length. Although I believe in
quality not quantity, some articles can be understood from only the title and a
title alone cannot make an article. Some other articles feel superficial to me
after writing them thus I keep writing articles and deleting (or sometimes,
constantly editing) them.</p>
<h3 id="marketing-is-also-hard">Marketing is also hard</h3>
<p>Between the downvotes and the harsh comments on Reddit and Hacker News,
marketing an article is as hard as writing it. Currently, I use Twitter and
Reddit to share my articles. The downvotes and the harsh comments with no
constructive feedback are a bit frustrating sometimes even though I believe I
don&rsquo;t write for everyone. What I mean by I don&rsquo;t write for everyone is that the
targeted audience for each article might differ thus building an audience for the blog is difficult.</p>
<h3 id="how-i-write">How I write</h3>
<p>Currently the way I write is as follows:</p>
<p>First, I come up with an idea and/or a title, generate a page for the article,
and fire up a text editor. I start by writing the main headlines in the
article. I then start filling the main points as fast as possible without
editing them. Afterwards, I edit the article, and fix the typos.</p>
<p>How I want to write though is writing consistently. No matter how many new
year&rsquo;s resolutions I may make, I never keep writing consistently as I want to.
However recently, I&rsquo;ve been writing every other week or so. I also want to
write fearlessly. The fear of writing a bad article is what always stops me
from writing or publishing an article.</p>
