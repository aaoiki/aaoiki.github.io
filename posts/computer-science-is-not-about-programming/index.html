          <p>This is not yet another war post about the difference between this and that. In
fact, what&rsquo;s motivated me to write this post is a TA at my university who was
shaming students who graduate university without learning how to program
properly. This idea was intriguing to me as I thought to myself that computer
science is not about programming!</p>
<p><img src="/images/hamada_helal_hamada_helal.jpg" alt="Hamada Helal, the king of obvious"></p>
<p>Actually, what I believe is that computer science is about computing. According
to Merriam-Webster, the definition of computer science is &ldquo;a branch of science
that deals with the theory of computation or the design of computers&rdquo;.  On the
other hand, programming is merely one way to do computation, supposedly, in a
short period of time using a big calculator that is a computer (I know, cell
phones exist!). Having computers do calculations for us is just an extra
privilege.</p>
<p>More so, computations don&rsquo;t have to be done on a computer. An A4 sheet of paper
and a pencil could be used as a computer, although this is much slower and many
times harder to follow and keep track of compared to a regular computer.  There
are indeed many ways to do computations without a programming language. A
theoretical model of computation is a model which describes how a set of
outputs are computed given a set of inputs. One of the most famous models of
computation is the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Turing_machine"><em>Turing machine</em></a>.
A Turing machine is an abstract computer that has an infinite memory and can
sequentially traverse this memory as needed. It resembles a program which takes
an input and computes an output (in terms of accepting or rejecting the input)
but has access to an infinite memory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Computer science is about computing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have seen many students who were excellent students but were poor programmers
and that&rsquo;s totally fine. Those students, if they want to, can pick up academia
and research for example, become computer scientists and excel at that.  In
contrast, I consider myself a fairly good programmer, however; I also consider
myself a not-so-good student. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a choice between either of
this or that; of course, this is not a general rule. One can be a good academic
and a good programmer at the same time.</p>
<p>The thing about degrees is that computer science students expect that their
major should include more &ldquo;programming&rdquo; courses and they blame their degrees
for the lack of computer programming classes (I used to think that way when I
started my degree). However, what they are missing here is what computer
science is actually concerned with —namely, the theory behind computation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, computer programming is only one form of doing computation.
Understanding the theory behind computation is different from writing programs
to do the computation.</p>
